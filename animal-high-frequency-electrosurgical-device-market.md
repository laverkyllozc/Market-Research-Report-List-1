<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Animal High Frequency Electrosurgical Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Unipolar"</li><li>"Bipolar"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Animal High Frequency Electrosurgical Device Market is divided into two main types: unipolar and bipolar. Unipolar devices utilize a single active electrode that delivers high-frequency current through the patient to a grounding pad, enabling broader surgical applications, particularly for cutting and coagulating tissue. Conversely, bipolar devices feature two electrodes that deliver current directly between them, minimizing thermal spread and better controlling tissue damage, making them ideal for delicate surgeries in animals. Both types cater to specific veterinary needs.</p></p>
